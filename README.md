This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming: creating a data frame with inconsistent column lengths. The `bug.R` file contains code that reproduces this error. The resulting data frame will have unexpected behavior, such as truncated columns or unexpected NA values. The `bugSolution.R` file provides a solution to this problem by ensuring all columns have the same length before creating the data frame. This is crucial for data integrity and accurate analysis.
